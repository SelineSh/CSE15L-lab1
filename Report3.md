Part 1

A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, 
as a JUnit test and any associated code:

```
  @Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = { 4, 8, 5, 6};
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{6, 5, 8, 4}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```


An input that doesnâ€™t induce a failure,
as a JUnit test and any associated code 

```
 @Test
  public void testReversed() {
    int[] input1 = { };
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ }, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
  }
```

The symptom, as the output of running the tests

The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it

Before:

``` 
static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return arr;
  }
```

After:

```
    static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
    int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
    return newArray;
  }
```

Before the change, the code tries to make ```arr``` 
equal to the flipped ```newArray```. But the ```newArray``` 
doesn't have any content inside it, it only has 
the same length as ```arr```. Only ```arr``` has content 
inside. So it should be ```newArray``` as the save place 
to store the flipped ```arr```.


Part 2

``` grep -c``` 

The ```grep``` command is used to search for patterns in text.

The ```-c``` option is used to count the number of lines that match the pattern.

```
$ grep -c "All" ./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
    3
```
This command looks for the match string ```All``` in technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt and notes how many lines there are, and prints out the number. It is used to know how many lines appear string ``All`` in the file.

```
$ grep -c "way" ./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
    2
```

This command looks for the match string ```way``` in technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt and notes how many lines there are, and prints out the number. It is used to know how many lines appear string ```way``` in the file.

```grep -w```

The ```grep``` command is used to search for patterns in text.

The ```-w``` option is used to search patterns in the text. And make sure that it is matching a complete word, not a part of it. Then print the line of the matching line

```
$ grep -w "All" ./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
        for relevant covariates [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] . All studies found
          All analyses were performed separately for men and

This command searches technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt for how many whole words ```All``` and prints the line where the word ```All``` appears. It's used to only look for the word ```All```, and doesn't want to look for All as part of a word.

```

This command searches technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt for how many whole words ```way``` and prints the line where the word ```way``` appears. It's used to only look for the word ```way```and doesn't want to look for way as part of a word.

```grep -n```

The ```grep``` command is used to search for patterns in text.

The ```-n``` option is used to search for pattern in the text and print the line number and line of the matching line.

```
$ grep -n "All" ./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
12:        for relevant covariates [ 1 2 3 4 5 6 ] . All studies found

This command searches for the string ```All``` in technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt and prints the contents and line numbers of the matching lines. It is used to make it easier to know on which line the string ```All``` appears.

This command searches for the string ```way``` in technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt and prints the contents and line numbers of the matching lines. It is used to make it easier to know on which line the string ```way``` appears.


```grep -i```

The ```grep``` command is used to search for patterns in text.

The ```-i ``` option is used to search case-insensitively and print the contents of matching lines.

```
$ grep -i "All" ./technical/biomed/1468-6708-3-1.txt
